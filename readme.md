# Larablog
This project is a side effect of my efforts to learn laravel and to show how to create an extremely simple Blogsoftware with laravel. I love laracasts and all those other tutorials but I approach PHP a different way and so I create this blogsoftware which is NOT for production use at the time writing (January 2019) but at least you get a glimpse and a step-by-step guide in Laravel.

The tutorial (https://www.trancefish.de/blog/show/lavarel/) is written in german, sorry. ;) 

At this time, we just have a small model, one tiny template and a small database-migration. This is absolutely not a complete blogging solution but I am working on it.

## Installation

* Clone Repository
* Create .env-File (by copying .env.example)
* Create Application key `php artisan key:generate`
* Create Database on your server
* Modify .env to your needs
* Migrate Database `php artisan migrate`

## Work in Progress

Keep in mind, this is a work in progress and NOT a complete blogging-software. As the tutorial on https://www.trancefish.de/ continues, these codes will grow to a blogging-system with at least those features I used on my other github-Project tlog4 https://github.com/marcshake/tlog.

I created this software to learn Laravel myself.
