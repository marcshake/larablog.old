# Larablog
This project is a side effect of my efforts to learn laravel and to show how to create an extremely simple Blogsoftware with laravel. I love laracasts and all those other tutorials but I approach PHP a different way and so I create this blogsoftware which is NOT for production use at the time writing (January 2019) but at least you get a glimpse and a step-by-step guide in Laravel.

The tutorial (https://www.trancefish.de/blog/show/lavarel/) is written in german, sorry. ;)
